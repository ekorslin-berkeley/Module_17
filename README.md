From May 2008 to November 2010, a banking client in Portual kicked off 17 different marketing campaigns with an aim to convert potential clients into actual clients.  With a reported 8% potential to acutal conversion rate, there clearly were some driving factors that would result in increased likelihood for successful conversion into actual, revenue-producing business for the bank.  A correlation analysis revealed that the upmost factor for driving a successful conversion was length of time the banking personnel member spent on the phone after cold-calling a potential client.  Second, was the month in which the call was made.

In determing which predictive model produced the most accurate predictive ability for a future phone call, each model was compared side-by-side.  Results showed Logitics Regressions to be the front-runner in terms of predictive accuracy for future call outcomes.

                          Model  Accuracy  Fit Time (seconds)
      0     Logistic Regression  0.916606            0.184514
      1     K-Nearest Neighbors  0.907623            0.063558
